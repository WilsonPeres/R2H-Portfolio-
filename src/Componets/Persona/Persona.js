My main role was to assist Wilson in technical skills as he progressed through the program. Over the months of this rigorous course, Wilson has continually impressed me. He has shown himself as someone who can quickly become adept at new technology, consume volumes of new information, and grow just as rapidly. His intrigue in coding and programming technologies is complemented by his professionalism and will certainly be a benefit in his career. He has been a pleasure to work with and I look forward to seeing what he does next.  "</p>
