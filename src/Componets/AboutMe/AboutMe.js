I am 25 years old and I am currently a student in the Road 2 Hire Tech Fellowship who's striving to become a front end developer. Majority of my professional career I have spend it working in sales. I've enjoyed my time helping customers gain knowledge on a variety of products I would provide them, but i've realized that my interests and passion is within web developing. My main goal is to start a new career in software engineering by learning new software languages and develop new skills that will enhance my personal knowledge while contributing to the advancement of a company.Â </p>
